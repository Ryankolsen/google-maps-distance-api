# Getting Started with Create React App

This application was designed using the react-places-autocomplete api to allow a user to search for any starting and destination address taking advantage of google's autocomplete to provide a dropdown with a selection of complete addresses.

The app uses an async loader in the Container class to connect to the Google API and uses an environmental variable for security.

Once the user selects a starting point and a destination, the app uses the starting latitude and ending longitude to display the Calculate Distance component. This component takes in the necessary props from the above noted address search and uses the DistanceMatrixService from hte react-google-maps API to query/fetch the response from googl maps.

The distance and driving time are displayed below with an option to add a trip name and save to local storage using the UseEffect hook. This allows a user to refresh the page and still be able to access the saved trips.

To run this app:
run npm init
npm start (dependencies are all noted in the package.json file)

Please note I did not focus much on CSS at all, I just played a bit and got familiar with the API's. I focussed more on the logic portion of this application.

...and here is all the standard React info:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
